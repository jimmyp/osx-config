# Setup

- first add the repo to your home dir by running `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimmyp/osx-config/master/config_download.sh)`
- then bootstrap the config by running `config_bootstrap.sh`

# WIP
- you must add `source ~/.bash_custom.sh` to your bash config. So on osx this is `~/.bash_profile`
